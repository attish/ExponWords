<h2>The basics</h2>
<p>ExponWords is a program for learning words. It helps learn the word
pairs fed by the user using the principle that the more we have already
practiced a word, the more rarely we need to practice it again.</p>
<p>So the main point of ExponWords is that the more times the user was able
to remember a word when the program asked, the less frequently it will be
asked (because it will be considered "stronger"). When a word is asked and
the user states that he remembers it, the word will be asked the next day;
if the users remembers the word the next day, it will be asked in 2 days;
if he knows it in 2 days, it will be asked in 4 days; and so on with powers
of 2. If the users admits on any of these occasions that he does not
remember the word, the strength of the word as stored by ExponWords will go
back to the initial level, and it will be asked again in 1 day, then 2
days afterwards, then 4 days afterwards etc. </p>
<p>ExponWords stores word pairs to be learnt. These can not only contain words,
but also expressions or anything the users wants to learn. For the sake of
simplicity though, they will be only referred to as word pairs. Word pairs have
the following elements:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Word in the first language: the word in the foreign language to be
  learnt.</li>
  <li>Word in the second language: the translation of the word to the
  native language of the user, or the definition of the word (in either
  language)</li>
  <li>Explanation: any text that should appear only when the program shows
  the solution. It may contain examples with the word, or it may even
  describe where the user first encountered the word.</li>
  <li>Strengths and dates of the word: the program stores the 1&rarr;2
  direction strength (i.e. how well the user can remember the word in the
  second language if the program prints it in the first language) and the
  2&rarr;1 direction strength (which is the opposite of the previous one)
  separately. The dates (when the word should be next asked) are also
  stored separately for the two directions.</li>
</ul>

<h2>User interface</h2>
<p>ExponWords has a global menu and a separate menu for each dictionary.</p>
<p>The global menu is available on the main page: the user can log in, log out, create dictionaries, set the options.</p>
<p>The dictionary menus are available from the dictionary page, which can be accessed from the main page by clicking on the name of the dictionary. The user can view, edit and delete the dictionary, add and import new words, and practice.</p>

  <li>Help: This page.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="practice">Practice</h3>
<p>The practice page contains the following elements:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Statistics (e.g. "<span class="transfer-related">5 (1)</span> / 6
  (<span id="answered-incorrectly">2</span>) / 10"): these numbers show the
  state of the current practice session. The meaning of the numbers is the
  following:
  <ol>
    <li>Number of the words answered and acknowledged by the server so far.</li>
    <li>Number of the words that the server has not yet acknowledged but
    the client is still trying to send them.</li>
    <li>Number of words answered so far.</li>
    <li>Number of words so far that the user did not remember.</li>
    <li>Number of all words that have been and will be asked by the server
    today.</li>
  </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Menu
  <ol>
    <li>Edit current word: editing the word being asked by the program. The
    effect of the modification will be seen only after refreshing the main
    page.</li>
    <li>Edit the previous word: editing the word previously asked by the
    program.</li>
  </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Buttons:</li>
  <ol>
    <li class="small_button_li"><span class="small-button">ANSWER</span>:
    the user shall press this button when he thought through whether he
    remembered the given word or not. After pressing the button, ExponWords
    will show the solution.</li>
    <li class="small_button_li"><span class="small-button">YES</span>: the
    user uses this button to show that he remembered the given word, so the
    interval before it is asked again can be longer than last time.</li>
    <li class="small_button_li"><span class="small-button">NO</span>: the
    user uses this button to show that he did not remember the given word,
    so it shall be asked again that day, then again 1, 2, 4, 8, etc. days
    later. </li>
  </ol>
  <li class="small_button_li">Word: the word being asked is shown with
  black color. After the <span class="small-button">ANSWER</span> button is
  pressed, the solution will be shown with blue, and the explanation will
  be shown in gray.</li>
