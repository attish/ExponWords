<h2>The basics</h2>
<p>ExponWords is a program for learning words. It helps learn the word
pairs fed by the user using the principle that the more we have already
practiced a word, the more rarely we need to practice it again.</p>
<p>So the main point of ExponWords is that the more times the user was able
to remember a word when the program asked, the less frequently it will be
asked (because it will be considered "stronger"). When a word is asked and
the user states that he remembers it, the word will be asked the next day;
if the users remembers the word the next day, it will be asked in 2 days;
if he knows it in 2 days, it will be asked in 4 days; and so on with powers
of 2. If the users admits on any of these occasions that he does not
remember the word, the strength of the word as stored by ExponWords will go
back to the initial level, and it will be asked again in 1 day, then 2
days afterwards, then 4 days afterwards etc. </p>
<p>ExponWords stores word pairs to be learnt. These can not only contain words,
but also expressions or anything the users wants to learn. For the sake of
simplicity though, they will be only referred to as word pairs. Word pairs have
the following elements:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Word in the first language: the word in the foreign language to be
  learnt.</li>
  <li>Word in the second language: the translation of the word to the
  native language of the user, or the definition of the word (in either
  language)</li>
  <li>Explanation: any text that should appear only when the program shows
  the solution. It may contain examples with the word, or it may even
  describe where the user first encountered the word.</li>
  <li>Strengths and dates of the word: the program stores the 1&rarr;2
  direction strength (i.e. how well the user can remember the word in the
  second language if the program prints it in the first language) and the
  2&rarr;1 direction strength (which is the opposite of the previous one)
  separately. The dates (when the word should be next asked) are also
  stored separately for the two directions.</li>
  <li>Labels: a list of words (separated by spaces), which help handle the word
  pair.</li>
</ul>

<h2>User interface</h2>
<p>ExponWords has a global menu and a separate menu for each dictionary.</p>
<p>The global menu is available on the main page: the user can log in, log out,
create dictionaries, set the options.</p>
<p>The dictionary menus are available from the dictionary page, which can be
accessed from the main page by clicking on the name of the dictionary. The user
can view, edit and delete the dictionary, add and import new words, and
practice.</p>

<h3 id="main-page">Main page</h3>

The main page has the following menu items:

<ul>
  <li>Log in</li>
  <li>Log out</li>
  <li>Dictionaries: List of dictionaries the user has.</li>

  <li>Options: The users can set their preferences here. It is not yet saved,
  so if the user logs out, the options have to be set again.</li>
  <li>Help: This page.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="dict-page">Dictionary page</h3>

The dictionary page shows activities that can be done to the selected
dictionary. It has the following menu items:

<ul>
  <li>Practice: Practices today's words with the user. See
  <a href="#practice">here</a> in more detail.</li>
  <li>Search: A search page that find words in the current dictionary. See
  <a href="#search">here</a> in more detail.</li>
  <li>List all words: A page that lists all words in the current
  dictionary.</li>
  <li>Add new word pair: Adding a new word to the database.</li>
  <li>Import word pairs from text: Imports word pairs from a text format.</li>
  <li>Export word pairs to text: Export word pairs to a text format.</li>
  <li>Import word pairs from tab separated values: The input format of this menu
  item is optimized for words copied from a spreadsheet application.</li>
  <li>Delete: Deleting the dictionary. Deleted dictionaries can be recovered
  only by the administrator.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="practice">Practice</h3>
<p>The practice page contains the following elements:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Statistics (e.g. "<span class="transfer-related">5 (1)</span> / 6
  (<span id="answered-incorrectly">2</span>) / 10"): these numbers show the
  state of the current practice session. The meaning of the numbers is the
  following:
  <ol>
    <li>Number of the words answered and acknowledged by the server so far.</li>
    <li>Number of the words that the server has not yet acknowledged but
    the client is still trying to send them.</li>
    <li>Number of words answered so far.</li>
    <li>Number of words so far that the user did not remember.</li>
    <li>Number of all words that have been and will be asked by the server
    today.</li>
  </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Menu
  <ol>
    <li>Edit current word: editing the word being asked by the program. The
    effect of the modification will be seen only after refreshing the main
    page.</li>
    <li>Edit the previous word: editing the word previously asked by the
    program.</li>
  </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Buttons:</li>
  <ol>
    <li class="small_button_li"><span class="small-button">ANSWER</span>:
    the user shall press this button when he thought through whether he
    remembered the given word or not. After pressing the button, ExponWords
    will show the solution.</li>
    <li class="small_button_li"><span class="small-button">YES</span>: the
    user uses this button to show that he remembered the given word, so the
    interval before it is asked again can be longer than last time.</li>
    <li class="small_button_li"><span class="small-button">NO</span>: the
    user uses this button to show that he did not remember the given word,
    so it shall be asked again that day, then again 1, 2, 4, 8, etc. days
    later. </li>
  </ol>
  <li class="small_button_li">Word: the word being asked is shown with
  black color. After the <span class="small-button">ANSWER</span> button is
  pressed, the solution will be shown with blue, and the explanation will
  be shown in gray.</li>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="search">Search</h3>
<p>The "Search" page can be used to search in dictionaries. The dictionary and
the label in which the search shall be performed can be selected. The text
typed into the textbox will be split into words (words shall be separated by
spaces). Only the word pairs containing all search words will be shown. If the
search box is empty, all word pairs will be printed.</p>
<p>The searchbox is case insensitive and accent insensitive, so for example a
search for "haz" will found the word pairs containing the text "HÃ¡z".</p>
<p>The "label:" prefix can also be used to search for a specific label, e.g.
the search expression "label:oldwords cat" will show the word pairs that
contain the "cat" word and have a label that contains the "oldwords" label,
even in part (so e.g.the words with "veryoldword" label will be found as
well).</p>

<h3 id="actions">Actions</h3>
<p>The "Search" page can also be used to perform certain actions on word pairs
that have been selected using the checkboxes in the "Selection" column.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Delete word pairs: deletes the selected word pairs.</li>
  <li>Move word pairs: moves the selected word pairs to the selected
  dictionary.</li>
  <li>Set dates and strengths: sets the dates and strengths of the selected
  word pairs to the given values. Those fields that are left empty are not
  modified.</li>
  <li>Add labels: adds the given labels to the selected word pairs.</li>
  <li>Remove labels: removes the given labels from the selected word
  pairs.</li>
  <li>Set labels: sets the labels of the selected word pairs to the given list.
  All other labels will be removed from the selected word pairs.</li>
  <li>Shift dates: shifts the dates of the word pairs (based on which the
  program decides when to ask the word pair) with the given days. For example
  if 3 days is typed, then a word which would otherwise be asked on 1st January
  will be asked only on 4th January. Negative numbers can also be specified: in
  this case the dates will be changed to earlier ones.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h2>
<ul>

  <li>
  <p><em>What happens if I leave the program in the middle of a practice
    session, and I have answered only some words, not all?</em></p>
  <p>This does not cause any problems. The words answered with "YES" will be
  updated to stronger strength, and they will be asked again accordingly. The
  other (not practiced) words will be asked when you reload the Practice
  page.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
  <p><em>What happens if I skip one or more days?</em></p>
  <p>This will not cause a problem either, these words will not be skipped. The
  program always asks all the words that should have been asked in the previous
  days.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
  <p><em>How does the program know whether I really knew the word asked?</em></p>
  <p>It does not, you tell this to the program. Since clicking or "YES" or "NO"
  when asked whether you know a word or not has no effect other than changing
  the word's strength and date, you can even manipulate this with good will.
  For example when I learn a word in the morning and add it to my dictionary,
  in the morning practice I often hit "NO" (as if I did not know the word) even
  if I knew it, because I want it to be asked again in the evening practice
  session.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
  <p><em>A word pair can be asked in two ways. For example if I'm Hungarian and
    I'm learning English, then the word can be asked in an
    English&rarr;Hungarian and in a Hungarian&rarr;English direction. How is
    this handled by the program?</em></p>
  <p>When practicing, these two directions are basically handled as two
  separate words. Both directions have separate strengths and separate dates
  (which show when to ask them the next time).</p>
  </li>

  <li>
  <p><em>The program cannot do something that I would like it to do. What can I
    do?</em></p>
  <p>There are several things in my <a
    href="https://github.com/hcs42/ExponWords/blob/master/TODO.txt">TODO list
    </a>. If you need something, you can e-mail me and if I like the idea I
    will add it to my list or (if it is already on the list) try to move it to
    the top.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
  <p><em>Which language can the program be used for?</em></p>
  <p>The program can be used for any language, because the words are added by
  you.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
  <p><em>In which order are the word to be practiced asked?</em></p>
  <p>In a totally random order.</p>
  </li>
