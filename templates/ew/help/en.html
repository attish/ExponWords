<h2 id="basics">The basics</h2>
<p>ExponWords is a web application for learning words. It helps learn the word
pairs fed by the user using the principle that the more we have already
practiced a word, the less we need to practice it again.</p>
<p>So the main point of ExponWords is that the more times the user was able
to remember a word when the program asked, the less frequently it will be
asked (because it will be considered "stronger"). When a word is asked and
the user states that he remembers it, the word will be asked the next day;
if the users remembers the word the next day, it will be asked in 2 days;
if he knows it in 2 days, it will be asked in 4 days; and so on with powers
of 2. If the users admits on any of these occasions that he does not
remember the word, the strength of the word as stored by ExponWords will go
back to the initial level, and it will be asked again in 1 day, then 2
days afterwards, then 4 days afterwards etc. </p>
<p>ExponWords stores word pairs to be learnt. These can contain not only words,
but also expressions or anything the users wants to learn. For the sake of
simplicity though, they will be only referred to as word pairs. Word pairs have
the following elements:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Word in the first language: the word in the foreign language to be
  learnt.</li>
  <li>Word in the second language: the translation of the word to the
  native language of the user, or the definition of the word (in either
  language)</li>
  <li>Explanation: any text that should appear only when the program shows
  the solution. It may contain examples with the word, or it may even
  describe where the user first encountered the word.</li>
  <li>Strengths and dates of the word: the program stores the 1&rarr;2
  direction strength (i.e. how well the user can remember the word in the
  second language if the program prints it in the first language) and the
  2&rarr;1 direction strength (which is the opposite of the previous one)
  separately. The dates (when the word should be next asked) are also
  stored separately for the two directions.</li>
  <li>Labels: a list of words (separated by spaces), which help handle the word
  pair.</li>
</ul>

<h2>User interface</h2>
<p>ExponWords has a global menu and a separate menu for each dictionary.</p>
<p>The global menu is available on the main page: the user can log in, log out,
create dictionaries, set the options.</p>
<p>The dictionary menus are available from the dictionary page, which can be
accessed from the main page by clicking on the name of the dictionary. The user
can view, edit and delete the dictionary, add and import new words, and
practice.</p>

<h3 id="dict-page">Dictionary page</h3>

The dictionary page shows activities that can be done to the selected
dictionary. It has the following menu items:

<ul>
  <li>Practice: Practices today's words with the user. See
  <a href="#practice">here</a> in more detail.</li>
  <li>Search and operations: A search page that finds word pairs in the current
  dictionary and allows operations on several word pairs. See

  only by the administrator.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="practice">Practice</h3>
<p>The practice page contains the following elements:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Statistics (e.g. "<span class="transfer-related">5 (1)</span> / 6
  (<span id="answered-incorrectly">2</span>) / 10"): these numbers show the
  state of the current practice session. The meaning of the numbers is the
  following:
  <ol>
    <li>Number of the words answered and acknowledged by the server so far.</li>
    <li>Number of the words that the server has not yet acknowledged but
    the client is still trying to send them.</li>
    <li>Number of words answered so far.</li>
    <li>Number of words so far that the user did not remember.</li>
    <li>Number of all words that have been and will be asked by the server
    today.</li>
  </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Menu
  <ol>
    <li>Edit current word: editing the word being asked by the program. The
    effect of the modification will be seen only after refreshing the main
    page.</li>
    <li>Edit the previous word: editing the word previously asked by the
    program.</li>
  </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Buttons:</li>
  <ol>
    <li class="small_button_li"><span class="small-button">ANSWER</span>:
    the user shall press this button when he thought through whether he
    remembered the given word or not. After pressing the button, ExponWords
    will show the solution. The same effect can be achieved by pressing any
    key.</li>
    <li class="small_button_li"><span class="small-button">YES</span>: the
    user uses this button to show that he remembered the given word, so the
    interval before it is asked again can be longer than last time. The same
    effect can be achieved by pressing the "y" key.</li>
    <li class="small_button_li"><span class="small-button">NO</span>: the
    user uses this button to show that he did not remember the given word,
    so it shall be asked again that day, then again 1, 2, 4, 8, etc. days
    later.  The same effect can be achieved by pressing the "n" key.</li>
  </ol>
  <li class="small_button_li">Word: the word being asked is shown with
  black color. After the <span class="small-button">ANSWER</span> button is
  pressed, the solution will be shown with blue, and the explanation will
  be shown in gray.</li>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="search">Search</h3>
<p>The "Search and operations" page can be used to search in dictionaries. The
dictionary and the label in which the search shall be performed can be
selected. The text typed into the textbox will be split into words (words shall
be separated by spaces). Only the word pairs containing all search words will
be shown. If the search box is empty, all word pairs will be printed.</p>
<p>The searchbox is case insensitive and accent insensitive, so for example a
search for "haz" will found the word pairs containing the text "HÃ¡z".</p>
<p>The "label:" prefix can also be used to search for a specific label, e.g.
the search expression "label:oldwords cat" will show the word pairs that
contain the "cat" word and have a label that contains the "oldwords" label,
even in part (so e.g.the words with "veryoldword" label will be found as
well).</p>
<p>The program shows the search hits in a table. Showing this table can be
turned off by unchecking the "Show hits" checkbox. In this case, the program
will still perform the search and display the number of hits. The usual
operations can be performed as well; but they will be performed on all found
word pairs, there is no possibility of manually selecting a subset of them.</p>

<h3 id="operations">Operations</h3>
<p>The "Search and operations" page can also be used to perform certain
operations on word pairs that have been selected. Word pairs can be selected
with a single click on them. The selected word pairs are indicated by their
gray background and the state of their checkboxes in the "Selected" column.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Delete word pairs: deletes the selected word pairs.</li>
  <li>Move word pairs: moves the selected word pairs to the selected
  dictionary.</li>
  <li>Set dates and strengths: sets the dates and strengths of the selected
  word pairs to the given values. Those fields that are left empty are not
  modified.</li>
  <li>Add labels: adds the given labels to the selected word pairs.</li>
  <li>Remove labels: removes the given labels from the selected word
  pairs.</li>
  <li>Set labels: sets the labels of the selected word pairs to the given list.
  All other labels will be removed from the selected word pairs.</li>
  <li>Shift dates: shifts the dates of the word pairs (based on which the
  program decides when to ask the word pair) with the given days. For example
  if 3 days is typed, then a word which would otherwise be asked on 1st January
  will be asked only on 4th January. Negative numbers can also be specified: in
  this case the dates will be changed to earlier ones.</li>
  <li>Practice: jumps to the practice page that asks either all selected word
  pairs, or only those that are due today (based on their dates).</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="settings">Settings</h3>
<p>The followings can be set:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Language: The language of the user interface. See more information about
  the languages <a href="#ui_language">here</a>.</li>
  <li>Time zone: The time zone used to calculate the words to ask. UTC+0 is
  Greenwich Mean Time; the time zone is higher and higher as we go to the east
  (UTC+1, UTC+2, etc.) and lower and lower as we go to the west (UTC-1, UTC-2,
  etc.). The time zone set on the computer is shown on the Settings
  page; in most cases, that is the best value to set here.</li>
  <li>Turning point: By default, ExponWords will start asking the words that are
  due at a certain date from the very beginning of that day, i.e. at midnight
  (0:00), according to the time zone set above. A different turning point can
  be set here; e.g. if 3:00 is set, then the words that are due on a day are
  asked only after 3am that day. Negative values can also be set: -1:30 means
  that the words that are due on a day will be asked from 22:30 the previous
  day.</li>
  <li>Practice page arrangement: The arrangement of the Practice page can be
  set to "Normal" and "Less scrolling". The former fits better with the rest of
  the user interface, but the latter can be better on a device on which the
  browser automatically scrolls to the top after all clicks.</li>
  <li>Button size, question size, answer size, explanation size: The font size
  of different elements of the Practice page.</li>
  <li>Email address: This email address can be used to reset the password and
  to receive notifications.</li>
  <li>Send me emails when new ExponWords has new features: If checked in,
  emails about releasing and deploying new ExponWords versions will be sent to
  the email address above.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h2>
<ul>

  <li>
  <p><em>What happens if I leave the program in the middle of a practice
    session, and I have answered only some words, not all?</em></p>
  <p>This does not cause any problems. The words answered with "YES" will be
  updated to stronger strength, and they will be asked again accordingly. The
  other (not practiced) words will be asked when you reload the Practice
  page.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
  <p><em>What happens if I skip one or more days?</em></p>
  <p>This will not cause a problem either, these words will not be skipped. The
  program always asks all the words that should have been asked in the previous
  days.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
  <p><em>How does the program know whether I really knew the word asked?</em></p>
  <p>It does not, you tell this to the program. Since clicking or "YES" or "NO"
  when asked whether you know a word or not has no effect other than changing
  the word's strength and date, you can even manipulate this with good will.
  For example when I learn a word in the morning and add it to my dictionary,
  in the morning practice I often hit "NO" (as if I did not know the word) even
  if I knew it, because I want it to be asked again in the evening practice
  session.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
  <p><em>A word pair can be asked in two ways. For example if I'm Hungarian and
    I'm learning English, then the word can be asked in an
    English&rarr;Hungarian and in a Hungarian&rarr;English direction. How is
    this handled by the program?</em></p>
  <p>When practicing, these two directions are basically handled as two
  separate words. Both directions have separate strengths and separate dates
  (which show when to ask them the next time).</p>
  </li>

  <li>
  <p><em>The program cannot do something that I would like it to do. What can I
    do?</em></p>
  <p>There are several things in my <a
    href="https://github.com/hcs42/ExponWords/blob/master/TODO.txt">TODO list
    </a>. If you need something, you can e-mail me and if I like the idea I
    will add it to my list or (if it is already on the list) try to move it to
    the top.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
  <p><em>Which language can the program be used for?</em></p>
  <p>The program can be used for any language, because the words are added by
  you.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
  <p><em>In which order are the word to be practiced asked?</em></p>
  <p>In a totally random order.</p>
  </li>

  <li id="ui_language">
  <p><em>In which languages is the user interface available?</em></p>
  <p>Currently English and Hungarian. If you are interested in doing the
  translation for another language, please contact
  <script type="text/javascript">document.write(
    "<n uers=\"znvygb:pfnon.ubpu@tznvy.pbz\">zr</n>".replace(/[a-zA-Z]/g,
      function(c){
      return String.fromCharCode(
        (c<="Z"?90:122)>=(c=c.charCodeAt(0)+13)?c:c-26);}));
    </script>.</p>
