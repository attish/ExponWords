<h2 id="0-10">Version 0.10 (2011-11-06)</h2>

<p>New in this release:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>New web address</strong>:
  <a href="http://exponwords.com/">exponwords.com</a>.</li>
  <li>The names and languages of dictionaries <strong>can be
    modified</strong>.</li>
  <li><strong>Links</strong> on the front page to the <strong>"Practice"
    pages</strong>. The link text is the number of words due today.</li>
  <li>The <strong>"Practice" page</strong> shows the <strong>direction</strong>
  of the current question by printing an <strong>arrow</strong>.</li>
  <li>The front page shows the list of dictionaries in an <strong>alphabetical
    order</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="0-9">Version 0.9 (2011-09-15)</h2>

<p>New in this release:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Some things were <strong>renamed</strong>: "Action" &rarr; "operation",
  "Search" page &rarr; "Search and operations" page, "Options" &rarr;
  "Settings".</li>
  <li>The <strong>word pairs</strong> on the "Search and operations" page can
  be <strong>selected</strong> not only using the checkboxes, but by
  <strong>clicking anywhere</strong> on the <strong>word pair's row</strong>.
  The selected lines become gray.</li>
  <li>After <strong>adding a word pair</strong>, the next page will contain a
  <strong>link</strong> to the previously added word pair.</li>
  <li>You can <strong>register</strong> an account, change your password and
  reset it in case you have forgotten it.</li>
  <li>On the "Settings" page, the <strong>time zone</strong> and the
  <strong>turning point</strong> can be set besides the language. (The turning
  point is the time of the day when ExponWords will start asking the words of
  that day.)</li>
  <li>You can set your <strong>email address</strong> and <strong>whether you
    would like to receive emails</strong> about new features.</li>
  <li>You can choose between <strong>two arrangements</strong> for the
  <strong>"Practice" page</strong> and you can <strong>set the size</strong> of
  the buttons and text too.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="0-8">Version 0.8 (2011-08-28)</h2>

<p>New in this release:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The <strong>"Practice" page</strong> can be used with <strong>keyboard
    shortcuts</strong>:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>pressing any key is equivalent to clicking on the "ANSWER" button;</li>
    <li>pressing the "Y" or "I" key is equivalent to clicking on the "YES"
    button;</li>
    <li>pressing the "N" key is equivalent to clicking on the "NO" button.</li>
  </ul>
  <li><strong>Listing the hits</strong> can be <strong>turned off</strong> on
  the <strong>"Search" page</strong>. This is useful if you want to do the same
  operation on hundreds of word pairs (e.g. shift their dates), but the web
  browser would be too slow because of the large page or you want to spare your
  network usage.</li>
  <li><strong>Labels</strong> can be specified when <strong>importing word
    pairs</strong>; these labels will be added to the words.</li>
  <li>The <strong>"Show my future"</strong> page (available from the front
  page) was created that draws a <strong>graph</strong> displaying a prediction
  about the number of words that will be asked each day in the next two
  months.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="0-7">Version 0.7 (2011-08-10)</h2>

<p>New in this release:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The <strong>word pairs selected</strong> in the "Search" page <strong>can
    be practiced</strong>. You can choose either practicing all the selected
  words, or only those that are due.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="0-6">Version 0.6 (2011-07-30)</h2>

<p>New in this release:</p>
<ul>
  <li>On the <strong>"Search" page</strong>, the dates and strength of the
  selected word pairs can be <strong>modified at once</strong>, and also labels
  can be added, removed and modified at once.</li>
  <li>When a new word pair is added, ExponWords <strong>remembers</strong> the
  <strong>initial dates, strengths and labels</strong>. This way if several
  word pairs are to be added e.g. with the same label, the label has to be
  typed only for the first word pair; it will already be present in the form
  for the rest of the word pairs.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="0-5">Version 0.5 (2011-07-11)</h2>

<p>New in this release:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Moving word pairs</strong> (available from "Search page"):
  Multiple word pairs can be moved to another dictionary.</li>
  <li><strong>Shift dates</strong> (available from "Search page"): The dates of
  the word pairs (based on which the program decides when to ask the word pair)
  can be shifted with the number of given days. For example if 3 days is typed,
  then a word which would otherwise be asked on 1st January will be asked only
  on 4th January. Negative numbers can also be specified: in this case the
  dates will be changed to earlier ones. This can be useful if you did not have
  time to practice for a week, but do not want all the words due to be asked on
  the first day. Using this feature, ExponWords can act as if that one week did
  not exists.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="0-4">Version 0.4 (2011-06-27)</h2>

<p>New in this release:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Labels</strong> can be assigned to word pairs when editing them
  (a word pair may have several labels). They can be used to organize the
  dictionaries.</li>
  <li>The new <strong>"Search" page</strong> (which can be opened either from
  the main page or the pages of the dictionaries) allows us to search among the
  word pairs. The dictionary and the label to be searched can be selected.</li>
  <li><strong>Negative strengths</strong> can be used. For example if -2 is
  set, then the word will be asked today, tomorrow, the day after tomorrow, and
  only then will the frequency decrease.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="0-3">Version 0.3 (2011-03-20)</h2>
<p>New in this release:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Code released under GPLv3 (as <strong>open source</strong>
  software).</li>
  <li><strong>"(Help)" links</strong> on more pages.</li>
  <li><strong>"Select all" button</strong> added to the "View" page.</li>
  <li>Better user experience during practice sessions with bad <strong>network
    connections</strong> (the timeouts in the client were increased).</li>
  <li><strong>FAQ</strong> translated to English help pages. (It was already
  present on the Hungarian help page.)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="0-2">Version 0.2 (2011-03-13)</h2>

<p>New in this release:</p>
<ul>
  <li>ExponWords <strong>rewritten</strong> using the Django web
  framework.</li>
  <li>Users can log in using <strong>usernames and passwords</strong>.</li>
  <li>You can create <strong>multiple dictionaries</strong>.</li>
  <li>All details of a word pair (dates of next practices, strengths, etc.)
  <strong>can be changed</strong>.</li>
  <li>Word pairs can be <strong>deleted</strong>.</li>
  <li>The <strong>date of addition</strong> is stored for each word pair.</li>
  <li>The "Practice" page displays a <strong>link to the previous word</strong>
  (it can be useful if you realize that you did not actually know a word just
  after pressing "YES"; this way you can easy edit the word's strength).</li>
  <li>Better user interface, e.g. <strong>menus</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="0-1">Version 0.1 (2011-02-13)</h2>

<p>The first release of ExponWords had the following features:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Word pairs</strong> can be added and edited.</li>
  <li><strong>"Practice" page</strong> with link to editing the words.</li>
  <li>Word pairs can be copy-pasted from a spreadsheet application and
  <strong>added at once.</strong></li>
  <li><strong>English and Hungarian</strong> user interface and help
  pages.</li>
  <li><strong>No support yet</strong> for multiple dictionaries and multiple
  users.</li>
