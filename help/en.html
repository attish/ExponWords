    <h3>The basics</h3>
    <p>ExponWords is a program for learning words. It helps learn the word
    pairs fed by the user using the principle that the more we have already
    practiced a word, the more rarely we need to practice it again.</p>
    <p>So the main point of ExponWords is that the more times the user was able
    to remember a word when the program asked, the less frequently it will be
    asked (because it will be considered "stronger"). When a word is asked and
    the user states that he remembers it, the word will be asked the next day;
    if the users remembers the word the next day, it will be asked in 2 days;
    if he knows it in 2 days, it will be asked in 4 days; and so on with powers
    of 2. If the users admits on any of these occasions that he does not
    remember the word, the strength of the word as stored by ExponWords will go
    back to the initial level, and it will be asked again in 1 day, then 2
    days afterwards, then 4 days afterwards etc. </p>
    <p>ExponWords stores words and expressions to be learnt. For the sake of
    simplicity, they will be only referred to as words. Words have the
    following elements:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Word in the first language: the word in the foreign language to be
      learnt.</li>
      <li>Word in the second language: the translation of the word to the
      native language of the user, or the definition of the word (in either
      language)</li>
      <li>Explanation: any text that should appear only when the program shows
      the solution. It may contain examples with the word, or it may even
      describe where the user first encountered the word.</li>
      <li>Strengths and dates of the word: the program stores the 1&rarr;2
      direction strength (i.e. how well the user can remember the word in the
      second language if the program prints it in the first language) and the
      2&rarr;1 direction strength (which is the opposite of the previous one)
      separately. The dates (when the word should be next asked) are also
      stored separately for the two directions. These fields can be viewed in the 
      "<a href="/word-list">Word list</a>" page.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>User interface</h3>
    <p>The main page contains the following elements:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Statistics (e.g. "<span class="transfer-related">5 (1)</span> / 6
      (<span id="answered-incorrectly">2</span>) / 10"): these numbers show the
      state of the current practice session. The meaning of the numbers is the
      following:
      <ol>
        <li>Number of the words answered and acknowledged by the server so far.</li>
        <li>Number of the words that the server has not yet acknowledged but
        the client is still trying to send them.</li>
        <li>Number of words answered so far.</li>
        <li>Number of words so far that the user did not remember.</li>
        <li>Number of all words that have been and will be asked by the server
        today.</li>
      </ol>
      </li>
      <li>Menu
      <ol>
        <li><a href="/word-list">Word list</a>: A page that shows all words in a table. The words can also be edited.</li>
        <li><a href="/raw-word-list">Raw word list</a>: A page that shows all words in the same form as they are stored in the database.</li>
        <li><a href="/new-word">New word</a>: Adding a new word to the database.</li>
        <li><a href="/new-words">New words</a>: Adding several new words; optimized for words copied from a spreadsheet application.</li>
        <li><a href="/logout">Logout<a>: Logs out the user</li>
        <li><a href="/help">Help</a>: This page.</li>
        <li>"Current word: Edit": editing the word being asked by the program.
        The effect of the modification will be seen only after refreshing the
        main page.</li>
      </ol>
      </li>
      <li>Buttons:</li>
      <ol>
        <li class="small_button_li"><span class="small-button">ANSWER</span>:
        the user shall press this button when he thought through whether he
        remembered the given word or not. After pressing the button, ExponWords
        will show the solution.</li>
        <li class="small_button_li"><span class="small-button">YES</span>: the
        user uses this button to show that he remembered the given word, so the
        interval before it is asked again can be longer than last time.</li>
        <li class="small_button_li"><span class="small-button">NO</span>: the
        user uses this button to show that he did not remember the given word,
        so it shall be asked again that day, then again 1, 2, 4, 8, etc. days
        later. </li>
      </ol>
      <li class="small_button_li">Word: the word being asked is shown with
      black color. After the <span class="small-button">ANSWER</span> button is
      pressed, the solution will be shown with blue, and the explanation will
      be shown in gray.</li>
      </li>
    </ul>
