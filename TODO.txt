Important
---------

- English help page
- remove word (probably a button into the /edit-word page)
- using only relative links

Would be nice
-------------

- edit raw word list
- random should not be totally random: it could be deterministic within a day,
  but it should also have a pointer about which word is next so that if you say
  NO to a word, it will not come back if you reload the page only after
  answering the words not yet asked
- number of hits and misses in stats
- authentication using openid
- password should be pwd so that it will be remembered by the browser
- show the future
- "I said I knew that word but I have just realized I did not"
- showing "(n)" when having multiple occurrences of the same word
- word queue for words to be learnt
- turnaround time set by the user according to his timezone
- update_word should update the word only if the strength and date match
- update_word should send back an OK even if it realizes that the word has
  previously been update, because otherwise the green number will indicate that
  the word has not been processes by the server (the problematic scenario is
  when the ACK gets lost)

Wishlist
--------

- "We will have a word test tomorrow at school" mode:
    - asking only words added at a certain date, but asking them again and again
- importing/exporting CSV files
