Important
---------

- don't bound the forms
- HTTPS
- add new word: move the submit button to the right
- better design (CSS)
- screenshots
- using only relative links (HttpResponseRedirect)
- fix "Previous" link on the Practice page
- exporting words should be actions
- show source language on the practice page

Would be nice
-------------

- random should not be totally random: it could be deterministic within a day,
  but it should also have a pointer about which word is next so that if you say
  NO to a word, it will not come back if you reload the page only after
  answering the words not yet asked
- showing "(n)" when having multiple occurrences of the same word
- word queue for words to be learnt
    - "Activate words" page {0:30}
    - document that 9999-01-01 is special

Wishlist
--------

- importing/exporting CSV/JSON files
- authentication using openid
- logging
    - number of hits and misses in stats
- similar pages: memorize.com, szokincsfejleszto.hu,
  http://www.szokincs.hu/?action=showpage&page=newbie
- more efficient representation of words to practice within the practice page
