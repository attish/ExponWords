- set up smtp server on yuno

Important (before releasing as a public web service)
----------------------------------------------------

- userprofile for settings like locale
    - language
    - timezone
    - version notifications
    - colors
- turnaround time set by the user according to his timezone
- using the "message" framework or at least the session instead of having
  messages in the GET request
- fix ip address in logs
- HTTPS
- using only relative links (HttpResponseRedirect)
- Action > Operation, Options > Settings
- change email address

Would be nice
-------------

- more efficient representation of words to practice within the practice page
- random should not be totally random: it could be deterministic within a day,
  but it should also have a pointer about which word is next so that if you say
  NO to a word, it will not come back if you reload the page only after
  answering the words not yet asked
- showing "(n)" when having multiple occurrences of the same word
- word queue for words to be learnt
    - "Activate words" page {0:30}
    - document that 9999-01-01 is special

Wishlist
--------

- importing/exporting CSV files
- authentication using openid
- logging
    - number of hits and misses in stats
- similar pages: memorize.com, szokincsfejleszto.hu
- send newsletters from the EW server
