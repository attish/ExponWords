Top priority
------------

- better links instead of "../.." {0:20}
- search {1:00}
- labels (makes sense only if there is search)
    - label field {0:30}
    - view should show it {0:15}
    - search by label in a dropbox {0:30}
    - search by label in search expression {0:15}
- practice search {0:30}
- copy fields when adding a new word pair {0:30}
- actions on multiple word pairs:
    - move to other dictionary {1:00}
- shift dates {1:00}
- word queue for words to be learnt
    - active field {0:30}
    - view should show it {0:15}
    - "Activate words" page {0:30}

- show the future {4:00}

Important (before releasing as a public web service)
----------------------------------------------------

- fix ip address in logs
- userprofile for settings like locale
- turnaround time set by the user according to his timezone
- using only relative links (HttpResponseRedirect)
- HTTPS
- interface for registration
- interface for changing the password

Would be nice
-------------

- random should not be totally random: it could be deterministic within a day,
  but it should also have a pointer about which word is next so that if you say
  NO to a word, it will not come back if you reload the page only after
  answering the words not yet asked
- showing "(n)" when having multiple occurrences of the same word

Wishlist
--------

- "We will have a word test tomorrow at school" mode:
    - asking only words added at a certain date, but asking them again and again
- importing/exporting CSV files
- authentication using openid
- logging
    - number of hits and misses in stats
