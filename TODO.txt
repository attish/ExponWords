Top priority
------------

- jump to the main page after login
- print an editable word list
    - print the word list
    - "Edit" link next to each word to /edit-word?word=12

Important
---------

- edit raw word list
- "-f" should be relative to the starting path
- English help page

Would be nice
-------------

- random should not be totally random: it could be deterministic within a day
- number of hits and misses in stats
- authentication using openid
- password should be pwd so that it will be remembered by the browser
- show the future
- "I said I knew that word but I have just realized I did not"
- showing "(n)" when having multiple occurrences of the same word
- remove word (probably into the /edit-word page)

Wishlist
--------

- "We will have a word test tomorrow at school" mode:
    - asking only words added at a certain date
- importing/exporting CSV files
