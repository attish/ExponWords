Important (before releasing as a public web service)
----------------------------------------------------

- use Django 1.3
- fix ip address in logs
- userprofile for settings like locale
- turnaround time set by the user according to his timezone
- using only relative links (HttpResponseRedirect)
- HTTPS
- interface for registration
- interface for changing the password

Would be nice
-------------

- labels
- better links instead of "../.."
- random should not be totally random: it could be deterministic within a day,
  but it should also have a pointer about which word is next so that if you say
  NO to a word, it will not come back if you reload the page only after
  answering the words not yet asked
- show the future
- showing "(n)" when having multiple occurrences of the same word
- word queue for words to be learnt

Wishlist
--------

- "We will have a word test tomorrow at school" mode:
    - asking only words added at a certain date, but asking them again and again
- importing/exporting CSV files
- authentication using openid
- logging
    - number of hits and misses in stats
