Priority
--------

- advanced calc, early review
- redesign
- bugfix

User features
-------------

- markup or HTML in words
- pronounce words with Forvo or Google Translate
- word queue for words to be learnt
    - word pairs should have a direction (->, <- or <->)
    - setting for queue labels
    - add word pair, import word pairs

User features: motivation
-------------------------

- stats:
    - number of hits and misses
    - number of active users
    - future: only show important dictionaries
- gamification, earn points, badges

User features: teaching
-----------------------

- teachers can add words for students
- teachers can access statistics of relevant dictionaries of students
- online tests, generate offline tests

Practice page
-------------

- sorting the dictionaries
- automatically jump to the next dictionary at the end of practice

Practice page 2.0
-----------------

- the server remembers everything (word list for the day)
- the client has a buffer of 200 words
- the client is notified when a word is added or changed
- undo: the server and the client remember even operations
- edit words within the page
- question: when to ask failed words?

Practice algorithm
------------------

- implement advanced "strength/next date calculation" (strength2 = strength1 +
  dimness_today; date2 = date1 + 2^strength1 * dimness_today)
    - practicing selected words should use this method too
- early practice: it should ask "do you want to go on?" after finishing the
  practice
- add SuperMemo/Anki ideas
    - use special labels, e.g. "!sm2" for using SM-2 on a word pair
    - use 6 days as second interval (label "!6")
    - use easyness factor (label "!ef")
- stats about the effectiveness of the algorithm
    - percentage of YES/NO answers (per word strength)
    - retention rate (per word strength)

Settings
--------

- setting for setting the basic font size
- Search&Operations page: show dimness optionally
- setting for whether to show tomorrow's dimness, label, etc. on the practice page

Design
------

- redesign the design (http://24ways.org/2012/how-to-make-your-site-look-half-decent/)
- settings page: group the settings (e.g. a "Practice page" group would be good)

  views.operation_on_word_pairs
- announcement: %USER, link to unsubscribe

Help
----

- FAQ: word order
- document "Import text" format
- help pages: "user" -> you - ask others' opinions
- add more "help for this" text
- help: add screenshots

Server
------

- undelivered email
- email backup
- Investigate the Opera problem further
- Add outlog and errlog to cgi start
- nginx caching
- XHTML validation
- HTTPS

Code style
----------

- think about CR and LF newlines
- using JQuery delegates
- using only relative links (HttpResponseRedirect)
- don't bind the forms
