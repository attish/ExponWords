Important
---------

- English help page
- remove word (probably a button into the /edit-word page)

Would be nice
-------------

- edit raw word list
- random should not be totally random: it could be deterministic within a day
- number of hits and misses in stats
- authentication using openid
- password should be pwd so that it will be remembered by the browser
- show the future
- "I said I knew that word but I have just realized I did not"
- showing "(n)" when having multiple occurrences of the same word

Wishlist
--------

- "We will have a word test tomorrow at school" mode:
    - asking only words added at a certain date
- importing/exporting CSV files
