Fairly important (before releasing on GitHub as "master" branch)
----------------

- publish INSTALL.txt

Quite important (before releasing as a public web service)
---------------

- English help pages: FAQ
- fix ip address in logs
- userprofile for settings like locale
- turnaround time set by the user according to his timezone
- using only relative links (HttpResponseRedirect)

Would be nice
-------------

- The "Edit previous word" link should be gray and not non-existent in the
  beginning
- better links instead of "../.."
- random should not be totally random: it could be deterministic within a day,
  but it should also have a pointer about which word is next so that if you say
  NO to a word, it will not come back if you reload the page only after
  answering the words not yet asked
- show the future
- showing "(n)" when having multiple occurrences of the same word
- word queue for words to be learnt
- update_word should update the word only if the strength and date match
- update_word should send back an OK even if it realizes that the word has
  previously been update, because otherwise the green number will indicate that
  the word has not been processes by the server (the problematic scenario is
  when the ACK gets lost)

Wishlist
--------

- "We will have a word test tomorrow at school" mode:
    - asking only words added at a certain date, but asking them again and again
- importing/exporting CSV files
- authentication using openid
- logging
    - number of hits and misses in stats
